# SpotTheBot
This is my final qualifying work.

What was done:
1. Analyzing a multidimensional time series obtained by means of a vector representation of text words
2. Implemented subspace clustering algorithm based on "FINDIT" (Kyoung-Gu Woo)
3. Implemented "Distinguishing Noise from Chaos" (Martin, Plastino, Rosso, Larrondo)
4. Comparatively evaluated clusters of people and bots using indicators that evaluate their compactness, separability and heterogeneity
